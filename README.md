# Dumbest Manmade Ciphering Algorithm

## Idea source

I always wanted to create my own ciphering / code obfuscation algorithm.

Then I ran into [this image](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/352206390896492544/942146755074613298/image_62cef0c4-933f-4640-8fc3-28a8d9e2ac1620220212_205407.jpg?width=468&height=649).

## Why this name

I had to find a new name for this improvised algorithm. The name DMCA immediately popped, and I had to find what could be shortened into DMCA. And that's how Dumbest Manmade Ciphering Algorithm was born. Doubles as a funny self-deprecation.
